A simple Universal JavaScript feature switch framework for React.

## How it works
You store a key value pair of feature settings in your database, a flat file, or hard coded in your application, and then use those flags to determine if and how to render your application and its constituent components.

This repository is a working example of how to implement this functionality, and also provides the related tools to do so.

As an added benefit, you can also override your own default settings by using either the query string in the address bar or by passing a cookie to your server.
